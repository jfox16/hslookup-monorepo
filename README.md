## Technical deets
- The backend is running Node.js on an AWS EC2 instance. It queries the official Blizzard Hearthstone API to get up-to-date data, then processes it for use with the frontend.
- Parses card text to determine the keywords that apply to the card itself, not just keywords that appear in the text.
- The entire Hearthstone card library is not incredibly large (only ~2 MB) so the frontend can fetch the entire library and work with it on the client. This optimizes network usage and sorting time.
- The UI works great on desktop and mobile!
- The frontend takes the mana cost, health, and attack of all filtered cards and shows histograms and averages after filtering.
